        Explanation:
        In java we have garbage collector which check if any var is not in use or referenced anymore it just deletes it 
        and free up memory so once use of some class, var or anything is done its get deleted.
        It is advised in java that we shouldn't create any var so early if it's going to used up later to save memory.
